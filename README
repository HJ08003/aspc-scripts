# Example Tigress Script

## Disclaimer

These scripts are intended as an example of how to use HPC resources (TIGRESS)
at Princeton University. The various examples comprise different use cases and
can be customized to anyone's liking. Nothing is a substitute for reading the
man page: just run `man qsub` for a starting point.

## Contents

There are a total of five sets of scripts in this project. Each set can be used
to submit a perfectly legal job on Della (and elsewhere, usually). They are
located in `./examples/`. The shell scripts with a `.pbs` suffix are PBS scripts
for the resource manager to submit. The scripts with a `.R` suffix are R scripts
that represent our computational jobs.

### ex0 -- bare bones

This is a bare bones example. It requests 1 node with 1 processor on the
node. It allows the scheduler to kill the job after 10 minutes. The script
simply generates 1,000 random numbers using the `Rscript` interface.

### ex1 -- a reasonable default

### ex2 -- ex 1 + an R script

### ex3 -- ex 2 + parallel execution + passing arguments to R

### ex4 -- ex 2 + multiple simultaneous submissions + passing arguments to R
